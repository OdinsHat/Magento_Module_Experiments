## First Widget Experiment

Using the [NHTSA API](http://www.nhtsa.gov/webapi/Default.aspx?Recalls/API/83)
(The US version of the [Euro NCAP](http://www.euroncap.com/home.aspx) safety ratings)
it will retrieve car safety data.

Some possible uses:

* Car safety data on displayed product.
* Car safety rating of least safe car.
* Car safety data of particular brand and model.

Granted - all American. But EuroNCAP have promised to release an API
on their next web refresh and this is for purely Magento educational
purposes at the moment to get used to the system.

*An API could be constructed of the EuroNCAP data
using web scraping but whether this would be in
breach of their site terms isn't
something I've checked.*

*There is some precdent for this being done for
other API's in the past though*
