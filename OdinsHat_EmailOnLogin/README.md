## Observers/Events Experiment

Some quick experiments to get an idea of hooking into Magento's large event system.
For reference - works in a similar fashion to:

* Wordpress `add_action()` function [as seen at the bottom of this file](https://github.com/OdinsHat/AWIN-Feeder/blob/master/awin-feeder.php) in my AWIN Feeder plugin.
* Joomla Content Plugins
